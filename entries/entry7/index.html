          Halloween has a long-standing association with candy, especially
          through the popular tradition of trick-or-treating. This practice, in
          which children go door-to-door asking for treats, has become almost
          synonymous with Halloween in many countries, particularly in the
          United States.

          The connection between candy and Halloween can be traced back to the
          mid-20th century, when candy manufacturers began marketing their
          products specifically for the holiday. Before the 1950s,
          trick-or-treaters were given a variety of items, including coins,
          fruit, and homemade treats. However, concerns about food safety,
          coupled with the convenience of pre-packaged goods, led to candy
          becoming the dominant treat for Halloween.

          Trick-or-Treating itself has roots in the Celtic tradition of Samhain,
          where people would dress up in costumes to ward off ghosts and
          spirits. In some early forms of trick-or-treating, people would go
          door-to-door in costume, performing tricks or songs in exchange for
          food or coins, which evolved into the modern exchange of candy.

          Over the years, candy has come to symbolize the fun and indulgence of
          Halloween, with households giving out treats to children in festive
          packaging. Many popular candies, such as Snickers, Reeseâ€™s, and candy
          corn, are marketed specifically for Halloween, and the holiday is a
          significant revenue generator for the candy industry.

          By focusing on trick-or-treating, the role of candy becomes more than
          just a treat; it is a way for communities to engage with one another,
          and for children to experience a sense of adventure and excitement.
          The simplicity of giving candy, combined with the tradition's deep
          cultural roots, solidifies candy as an essential part of Halloween
          festivities.
